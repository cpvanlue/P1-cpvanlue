# Project 1, Iteration 1: Rich Aliens
A project by Caleb Van Lue.

## How to Play
The objective of this simple iteration is to use the alien to collect the coin on screen. In order to do that, you must aim the alien to the proper angle and use the appropriate strength to project toward the coin. To increase/decrease the Power bar, use the Left and Right arrow keys. To increase/decrease the angle at which you are aiming, use the Up and Down arrow keys. Once you are ready to launch, press the Spacebar to send your alien flying toward the coin! Score is incremented by 10 points for each coin collected.

## Project Report

This iteration really helped me understand how Godot Game Engine is object-oriented. Utilizing nodes as children of other nodes and giving each scene its own attributes and methods really reminded me of the process of learning Java, another object-oriented language. While coding, I found it incredibly useful to ask myself, "What object is this one interacting with?" Questions like that helped me understand what my code was doing and where each line was going, which made this project both more enjoyable and understandable.

- [X] C-6: The player can control the angle at which the projectile is fired.
- [X] C-7: The player can fire the projectile.
- [X] C-8: The projectile's flight is affected by gravity using Godot Engine's physics system.
- [X] C-9: There is a &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that stops the projectile.
- [X] C-10: There is a non-ground target that the projectile can hit.
- [X] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration and self-evaluation, as defined above.
- [X] B-2: The projectile's firing angle is clamped between 0&deg; (straight forward) and 90&deg; (straight up).

- [X] A-3: The projectile's hitting the target is recognized and logged to the console or otherwise indicated.

I believe that I properly deserve an A on this submission.
