# Project 1, Iteration 3: Rich Aliens
A project by Caleb Van Lue.

## How to Play
The objective of this iteration is to use the alien to collide with the coins on screen. In order to do that, you must aim the alien to the proper angle and use the appropriate strength to project toward the coins. To increase/decrease the Power bar, use the Left and Right arrow keys. To increase/decrease the angle at which you are aiming, use the Up and Down arrow keys. Once you are ready to launch, press the Spacebar to send your alien flying toward the coins! Score is incremented by 10 points for each coin collision. Each round allows for 3 projectile shots.

## Project Report

I feel that this iteration of the project really allowed my mind to click when it comes to Godot engine. By this point, I've figured out the process that works best for me when creating software in a project like this, but that was something that I struggled with while trying to learn Godot. Trying to design a new software concept while working in a new programming environment was a bit overwhelming in the first few weeks of the course, but once I've gotten the hang of it, I feel quite comfortable working with this engine. I believe that versatility and flexibility is important when it comes to software engineering, and so far, this course has helped improve those skills for me.
