# Project 1, Iteration 2: Rich Aliens
A project by Caleb Van Lue.

## How to Play
The objective of this iteration is to use the alien to collide with the coins on screen. In order to do that, you must aim the alien to the proper angle and use the appropriate strength to project toward the coins. To increase/decrease the Power bar, use the Left and Right arrow keys. To increase/decrease the angle at which you are aiming, use the Up and Down arrow keys. Once you are ready to launch, press the Spacebar to send your alien flying toward the coins! Score is incremented by 10 points for each coin collision. Each round allows for 3 projectile shots.

## Project Report

This iteration truly tested my understanding of signals in Godot. I spent quite some time working with signals on the Ball and Coin objects, trying to figure out what would work and what wouldn't. There was quite a bit of frustration, but that always leads to exciting breakthroughs. I also refactored some of my code from the previous iteration to rely more on code rather than the Node graphical interface. Things like the creation of new projectiles are made much easier in my mind when solely relying on the code. Overall, I'm proud of the progress I made this iteration and I think this project is well set up for the next one.
